    <h3>A crispy tortilla pizza with all your favorite pizza toppings!</h3>
    <p>A crispy tortilla pizza is an easier and healthier alternative to a traditional pizza, 
        with all your favorite pizza toppings! Perfect for lunch or dinner.
        These personal pizzas can be customized to your liking, and they only 
        take a few minutes to make!</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 Flour Tortillas. You'll need 8 to 10-inch, burrito-sized tortillas.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Pizza Sauce. Marinara is a delicious alternative. Either way, divide this into 2 portions.</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Mozzarella. Shred it up, and divide it into 2 portions.</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Parmesan Cheese. Treat this the same as the mozzarella, shredded and divided.</li>
        <li>24 slices Pepperoni. You can always add more depending on the size of your pepperoni. Divide these into 2 portions.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Now the chemical process:</h3>
<p>There are only <strong><em>three easy steps!</em></strong> Get out a baking sheet, a pizza cutter, and a wooden spoon to begin.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prep your oven and your dough. Preheat your oven first. It should be set to 425℉ (218℃). 
    Move the rack to the center of the oven and place a large baking sheet on it as the oven heats. 
    Then, lay out 2 flour tortillas on a clean workspace. Smear 1/4 cup pizza sauce over each.</li>
<li>Add your toppings. Next, spread about 1/4 cup mozzarella cheese on each tortilla. 
    Then, do the same with ¼ cup each of Parmesan cheese. 
    Top it with 12 slices of pepperoni each. 
    Sprinkle on some garlic salt to taste, if you'd like.</li>
<li>Bake, slice, and serve. Transfer the assembled pizzas to the hot baking sheet and cook for approximately 5 minutes. 
    Take it out when the cheese is melted and the tortillas are crisp. Let it cool for a couple of minutes. Then, slice and serve.</li>
</ol>
