        <ol>
            <li>Make Filling First</li>
            <p>To make the filling it's just a matter of boiling the potatoes in a large pot over medium heat with salted water and waiting until they're fork tender. 
                Then drain.</p>
                <p>In a large skillet saut√©ing onion and garlic in a little olive oil and cooking until soft. 
                    Then adding the cooked and drained potato into the pan, and use a potato masher to start mashing until broken down.</p>
                    <p>You want a thick mashed potato consistency that sticks together. 
                        Before assembling the tacos the potato mixture needs to cool down and come to room temperature.</p>
                        <li>Once the potato filling is prepared and has come to room temperature then you can proceed.</li>
                        <li>Start by heating the vegetable oil in a large frying pan. 
                            Turn flame to medium-high heat and allow to heat up while you take the tortillas and warm them in the microwave for 15 seconds. 
                            They only need to be warm enough to become flexible and bend easy.</li>
                            <li>Grab a warm soft corn tortilla, in half of each tortilla place one heaping tablespoon of the potato mixture. 
                                Then fold in half into half moon shapes. Use a toothpick to weave through the top to pin it closed.
                                 If you'd like a tighter seal you can use 3 toothpicks to pin all three sides.</li>

                                <li>Line a large plate with paper towel to drain off excess oil. 
                                    Carefully fry tacos in the hot oil until crispy and golden brown on both sides.</li>
                                    <li>Now to serve them</li>
                                    <p>All you need are the shredded cabbage or lettuce, vegan or regular cheese, tomato salsa and a good drizzle of Mexican crema.</p>
                                    <p>Nice and simple. But bursting with deliciousness!</p>
